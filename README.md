This script will look at all the route 53 entries with CNAMEs, check that agains the corresponding ELBs/ALBs, check to see if those URLs/resources are being used or not by running a host check against them, and then if there's no response, it will mark that as an unsued Route 53 entry and print that out to a file, upload it to S3, and the count of the number of used and unsed Route 53 entries will be output into Slack and will also tell the user where he needs to go to get the details
